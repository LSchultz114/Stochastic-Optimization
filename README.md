# Stochastic Optimization

Compares the following three stochastic optimization methods to a myopic and leave-alone strategy for finding the optimal strategy to allocate additional but limited resources to detection threat analysis:
\begin{list}{$*$}{}
	\item Adaptive Dynamic Programming
	\item Evolutionary Strategies
	\item Multi-stage Stochastic Programming (Non-Anticipativity)
\end{list}
